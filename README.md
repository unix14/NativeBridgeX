# native_bridge

Native Bridge is a Dart library designed to simplify the process of executing native code directly from Flutter. This project serves as a starting point for a Flutter application that requires interaction with native code.

## Features

- Execute native code directly from the Flutter code
- Demo code includes examples of:
  - Send push notifications
  - Set and get integer values
  - Login and logout test buttons
  - Open URLs in the native browser
  - Clear all notifications

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main directories:

- `android`: Contains the Android native code written in Kotlin.
- `ios`: Contains the iOS native code written in Swift.

To build and run the project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
flutter run
```

This command builds and installs the Flutter app to your connected device or emulator.
